 CRITICAL ANALYSIS: AI-Enabled Phishing Detection System

**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Status:** üî¥ PRODUCTION NOT READY
**Severity:** CRITICAL

---

## Executive Summary

The AI-enabled phishing detection system has **fundamental architectural and data problems** that prevent it from working as a general-purpose phishing detector. The system was designed for **CSE impersonation detection** (detecting fake versions of specific Indian PSU/bank websites) but is being used for **general phishing detection** - a completely different problem.

**Key Finding:** The model has **ZERO labeled phishing examples** and relies entirely on unsupervised anomaly detection from a narrow baseline of 116 Indian institutional websites.

## üìä Data Analysis Results

### Dataset Composition (129 domains analyzed)

| Metric | Value | Issue |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Phishing samples** | 0 (0%) | ‚ùå Cannot train phishing detection |
| **Benign samples** | 127 (98.4%) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Severe class imbalance |
| **Suspicious** | 1 (0.8%) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Unlabeled, unclear ground truth |
| **Government domains** | 23 (17.8%) | ‚ÑπÔ∏è Institutional bias |
| **Banking domains** | 30 (23.3%) | ‚ÑπÔ∏è Narrow domain focus |

**Critical Issue:** Without phishing examples, the model cannot learn what phishing looks like - it only knows what the CSE baseline looks like.

### CSE Baseline Analysis

- **Size:** 116 domains
- **Composition:** 100% Indian PSUs, banks, government sites
- **Coverage:**
  - ‚úÖ Indian institutional websites
  - ‚ùå E-commerce sites
  - ‚ùå Social media
  - ‚ùå International services
  - ‚ùå Generic business sites
  - ‚ùå Personal websites

**Impact:** Any website outside this narrow profile will be flagged as "anomalous"

### Visual Similarity Index

- **Size:** 51 screenshot embeddings
- **Composition:**
  - Banking: 37.3%
  - Other: 41.2%
  - Commercial: 11.8%
  - Government: 9.8%

**Problem:** With only 51 reference images, visual matching has:
- High false positive rate (different layouts match similar colors/structure)
- Low coverage (most legitimate sites not represented)
- Bias toward corporate/institutional designs

---

## ‚ùå Fundamental Problems

### 1. **NO SUPERVISED LEARNING** (CRITICAL)

**Problem:**
The anomaly detector (IsolationForest) is **unsupervised** - it has never seen labeled phishing examples.

**How it works now:**
```
Training: "Here are 116 Indian PSU/bank websites - this is normal"
Detection: "This website looks different from PSUs ‚Üí ANOMALY ‚Üí Maybe phishing?"
```

**What's wrong:**
- Legitimate but unique websites ‚Üí flagged as anomalies
- Sophisticated phishing (looks like CSE baseline) ‚Üí passes as normal
- Cannot distinguish phishing patterns from legitimate diversity

**Example failure:**
- Modern startup website with unique design ‚Üí ANOMALY (false positive)
- Perfect clone of SBI bank ‚Üí NORMAL (false negative)

---

### 2. **ARCHITECTURE PURPOSE MISMATCH** (CRITICAL)

**What it was designed for:** CSE Impersonation Detection
```
Goal: Detect fake versions of SPECIFIC known websites (SBI, HDFC, etc.)
Method: "Does this claim to be sbi.co.in but looks different from real SBI?"
Baseline: Known-good screenshots of 51 specific organizations
```

**What it's being used for:** General Phishing Detection
```
Goal: Detect ANY phishing website across all domains
Method: "Is this website phishing?" (without knowing what phishing looks like)
Baseline: Same 51 organizations (irrelevant for general detection)
```

**Result:** Square peg, round hole

---

### 3. **FEATURE SCHEMA BREAKDOWN** (HIGH)

**Model expects 42 features:**
```python
# Features the anomaly model was trained on:
- doc_has_login_keywords      ‚ùå Missing
- doc_has_verify_keywords     ‚ùå Missing
- doc_has_password_keywords   ‚ùå Missing
- cert_age_days               ‚ùå Missing
- ocr_has_login_keywords      ‚ùå Missing
- (+ 7 more missing)
```

**Crawler provides 92 features:**
```python
# Features crawler actually extracts:
- has_verdict                 ‚úì Different name
- risk_score                  ‚úì Different name
- ocr_text_length             ‚úì Different name
- (but missing the critical keyword detection features)
```

**Impact:**
- 12/42 features (28%) are missing or misnamed
- Model defaults missing features to 0
- All domains look the same on keyword features ‚Üí poor discrimination

**Root cause:**
- Keyword extraction code exists (`extract_text_features.py`)
- But runs OFFLINE during data prep, not at RUNTIME
- AIML service doesn't call it during live detection

---

### 4. **NO GROUND TRUTH VALIDATION** (HIGH)

**Missing validation infrastructure:**
- ‚ùå No labeled test set (phishing vs benign)
- ‚ùå No accuracy/precision/recall metrics
- ‚ùå No false positive rate measurement
- ‚ùå No A/B testing framework
- ‚ùå No model performance monitoring

**Impact:**
- Cannot measure if model is improving or degrading
- Cannot compare different model versions
- Cannot validate fixes work
- Flying blind

---

### 5. **DETECTOR WEIGHT IMBALANCE** (MEDIUM)

**Current ensemble weights:**
```python
'anomaly': 0.20     # Broken (feature mismatch)
'visual': 0.30      # High false positives (small index)
'content': 0.20     # Works, but limited
'domain': 0.15      # Works well, but LOWEST weight
'autoencoder': 0.15 # Works, but limited
```

**Problem:**
- Domain reputation (most reliable) has lowest weight
- Visual similarity (most flawed) has highest weight
- Anomaly detector (broken) still weighted at 20%

**Result:** False positives override correct signals

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Why This Happened

1. **Scope Creep**
   - Started as CSE-specific detector
   - Expanded to general phishing without architectural changes
   - Training data never updated

2. **Data Collection Failure**
   - No phishing sample collection pipeline
   - No labeling infrastructure
   - Relied on unsupervised learning

3. **Offline vs Runtime Gap**
   - Feature extraction exists but runs offline
   - Runtime detection uses incomplete features
   - No integration between data prep and live service

4. **No Validation Loop**
   - Model deployed without accuracy measurement
   - No feedback from false positives/negatives
   - No continuous improvement mechanism

## Conclusion

The system is **not broken** - it's working as designed. The problem is that it was **designed for CSE impersonation detection** but is being **used for general phishing detection**.

**Key insights:**

1. **Rule-based detection (crawler) works well** (98.4% accuracy on benign)
2. **ML detection is CSE-specific** and shouldn't be applied generally
3. **Feature pipeline has gaps** but can be fixed quickly
4. **No ground truth** means we're flying blind on accuracy
5. **Need to decide:** Fix for original purpose or redesign for new purpose

**Recommendation:** **Option C (Hybrid)** - prioritize rule-based detection, fix ML for CSE-only, add threat intelligence, and build measurement infrastructure.

2. **Choose architecture path** (A, B, or C)
3. **Allocate resources** based on chosen path
4. **Begin immediate fixes** (Priority 0 items)
5. **Set realistic timeline** for production readiness

**Current Status:** Not production-ready for general phishing detection
**Estimated Time to Production:** 1-3 months depending on chosen path
**Blocker:** Need labeled phishing dataset and validation framework
